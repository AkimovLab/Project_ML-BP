Nonadiabatic dynamics in pristine and divacancy-containing monolayer black phosphorus

* 0_structure_preparation - files with with the supercell and the original cif

* 1_md - molecular dynamics trajectories and setups

* 2_tddft  - static calculations with TD-DFT

* 3_nacs - computing nonadiabatic couplings in the SD and CI bases

* 4_analysis - plotting spectra, energy vs. time, NAC maps, etc. using data from step 3

* 5_namd - the NA-MD part, computed with the C++ implementation in Libra (on my local storage, it is called 6_namd_cpp)
